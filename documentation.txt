Things to Note as I forget when I move on to other builds

1.) When you invite somebody not in the system yet.
This is applicable to when you are inviting from the create page.

I set a confirmation boolean. False if you haven't registered. True if you have.
Oh this was to correctly display your profile when showing up-to-date results.

When you invite somebody not in the system yet, you create a profile for that email.
And it waits until it is confirmed.

2.) To make the manual image upload work. I have the blobstore link. Then I link to that source as an image tag.
