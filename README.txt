This is the official open-source project for VoteVite.

The original vision of this was taking wayyyy longer to develop than anticipated. In the meantime, I thought it'd be cool to just make it an "open source" project. Whatever that means...I've been throwing this up here on github for a while now, but without this official Readme. So until I'm able to make this more professional, here it is! P.S. Actually, just throwing this up here just so I can sound cool by saying I've made this "open-source."

Using Google App-Engine, AngularJs, Bootstrap, and D3Js.

I know it is a bit clunky. This was my first ever app. SuperBuggy.

So lower your expectations...

Anyways, I'll be continually coding this up to more stable versions, but just wanted to throw it out here on the internet to get things moving along as an open-source project.

Also, it is on Localhost port 12080 if you may be having problems with user login authentication.
